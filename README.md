# Description:

This library is an implementation of the FABRIK method(Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse kinematic) 
for a 3D manipulator in the Python programming language. and is released under the MIT software license 
and is under developement. It can simulate the Robot Manipulator behavior in reaching a target with consideration of 
the joints constraints.
NOTE: This library is under developement so there is some update in future.


# Usage:
You can change "Main" file for your usage,
First: Determine target position and orientation(in quaternion)
Second: Add specification for Base bone : All specification description is in the code
	NOTE: it's joint type can be "GLOBAL_HINGE" or "GLOBAL ROTOR" 
	or in case of FRANKA robot it is "twist_only" the last means it only rotate around itself.
Third: Add consecutive bones to the chain with specification:
	bone-length: length of the bone
	bone-orientation: the orientation of the bone in quaternion
	joint type: can be BALL(rotor-constraints) or local-hinge or twist-only
	constraints and axises of rotation
	 
Then Solve the chain
	
	
# OutPut:
Out-put is a diagram showing the final state of the manipulator( it will show after closing the initial diagram)
For FRANKA(with 7 joints) there is an array of joints degree can be seen as an output.
